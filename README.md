# RainRainGoAway


Objective : 
To improve decision-making of autonomous vehicles in case of rain. This system clears the haze and distortion caused by rain in order to improve visibility, and enhances the view at the same time.

Why? :
Lots of accidents have been caused by poor visibility as wipers are not always effective. Autonomous vehicles face an even more risky situation when driving in such weather as decisions can go wrong at the slightest misinterpretation of objects around it. This is exactly what we're trying to solve using this product.
